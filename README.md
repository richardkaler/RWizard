I work in cybersecurity. I fix broken thing which should have never been broken and I help my colleagues prevent such things from being broken in the first place. I excel in both red team and blue team environments but am slightly more passionate about offensive security. To mitigate vulnerabilities, we must first understand how and why threat actors behave - what makes them tick.
