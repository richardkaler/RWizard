I work in cybersecurity. I fix broken thing which should have never been broken and I help my colleagues prevent such things from breaking in the first place. To do this, sufficient security controls must be implemented both on a network level and by implementing well-written code. I excel in both red team and blue team environments but am slightly more passionate about offensive security. To mitigate vulnerabilities, we must first understand how and why threat actors behave - what makes them tick.
