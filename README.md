I work in cybersecurity. I fix broken thing which should have never been broken, and I help my colleagues prevent such things from breaking in the first place. To do this, sufficient security controls must be implemented both on a network level and by implementing well-written code. I excel in both red team and blue team environments but am slightly more passionate about offensive security. To mitigate vulnerabilities, we must first understand how and why threat actors behave i.e., what makes them tick. 

What you will find in this repo is unfinished as much more will be added. Things are always in flux and everything could stand to be a bit better - never could this prove more true than in the world of technology and code, a place where a single bug could prove disasterous for a countless number of people. If you are visiting my page for the first time, expect changes will be raidly made soon and some of them likely already have between the time I have written this and the time you are reading it.
